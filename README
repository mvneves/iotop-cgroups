This is a modified version to work with containers (e.g., LXC). It shows the
cgroup's name of each process and allows for per-container I/O monitoring.

Iotop is a Python program with a top like UI used to show of behalf of which
process is the I/O going on. It requires Python >= 2.7 and a Linux kernel >=
2.6.20 with the CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT CONFIG_TASKSTATS,
CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING and CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS options on.


To run a local version of iotop:

$ ./iotop.py


The documentation is available in the man page:

$ man ./iotop.8


To install iotop, you should use a package provided by your distribution. If you
really want to install this version of iotop on your system, do (as root):

# ./setup.py install
